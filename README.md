frontend for Domoticz with the looks of smartVISU
Hello world!
Let me get this straight. I am not at all a professional developer. I am the kind of amateur who can copy/paste and alter code according to my needs. Therefore, the code uploaded here will probably look like shit in the eyes of the real pro's.
And that's fine, I'm ok with that. I figured it out and got it to work. If you have a better idea, why don't you just upload it? Because that is one of the goals I had in mind by posting this repository:
SmartVISU is really beautiful and handy, at least in my opinion. However it only supports domotiga, KNX, FHEM, maybe some others, but not Domoticz. Actually I've been using Domotiga for several years and the main reason was that I could have smartVISU as the interface (on a wall-mounted tabled). Unfortunately I've been suffering some issues with domotiga causing the whole pc to slow down and its memory filling up, to the point that a forced reboot was needed to get things working again. And I had to do this every +- 3 days. It had something to do with my collection of shell scripts acting as a virtual device, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong (even a simple "cat blabla.txt" command caused a repeating increase of open pipes on the computer, and when the limit was reached no other commands could be executed).
So I looked into alternatives and many of my personal friends are using Domoticz. I appreciate it's an awesome piece of community-based software with loads of possibilities and its update frequency is rather high, which is a good thing in this world.
However, I was not satisfied with any frontpage I could find that was compatible with Domoticz, and me and SWMBO were really missing the smartVISU experience we had for so many years. So, I tried my best to create a user interface that works with Domoticz but has the looks and layout of smartVISU.
That involved refreshing my javascript skills I hadn't used for like 10 years, at best I had some basic experience with html, php and css. But I got to the point where I can say I made something. It's not a finished product, but imho a home automation user interface is never really "ready". It's a hobby and it changes almost every day, whenever I get a new idea.
By publishing this code I want to achieve 2 main things:
Provide Domoticz users with an interface they may like better, or at least give some examples of how they could realize their dream interface,
and get smarter people improving the code to make it more efficient; faster, better.
Stuff I still got to investigate and add: Graphs, caching, dim/blinds
enjoy!
